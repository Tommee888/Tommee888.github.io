            Paul declines your decision!
        </h1>
        <p>
            After making this horrible decision Paul lectures you about why you shouldnt be evil and why you should have fun instead. <br>
            You tell him that he is absolutely right and you should start having more fun. <br>
            Then you and Paul start playing hide n seek for hours :) <br>
            THE END
