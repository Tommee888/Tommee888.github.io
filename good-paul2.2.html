        <h1>Beware!</h1>
        <p>
            After transfering the secrets of the universe to some scientists minds, Paul tells you hes too tired to function properly because of his energy usage. <br>
            You guys heads back into the ship and begin to fly away until... <br>
            The ship gets hit by an oncoming missle aimed by the scientists themselves. <br>
            After teaching these people these secrets they got too greedy and wanted Pauls whole race wiped out. <br>
            But then...Paul yells, "Dont worry dawg I gotchu!" while peeing off the ship causing the earth to decay from the potency of his urine. <br>
            THE END
